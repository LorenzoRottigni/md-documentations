# MACHINE LEARNING

## Background explanations
- In normal programming we have y = f(x) and the programmer given an input writes the algoritmh that calculates the output. In ML a big input of x and y is given and the function is generated from the ML model.
- A big amount of data is used to "feed" the ML algoritmh, it uses the data to create and train the model that will interact with the final user.

## Python environment

The library the provides machine learning and data mining utils is named scikit-learn.
