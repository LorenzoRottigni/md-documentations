# Deep Learning

With Deep learning is meant the integration of neural network concept in Machine Learning.
It commonly uses specific frameworks such as Tensor Flow and pytorch but also Sklearn has a set of features for neural networks contained in neural_networks python module.

## Algoritmhs

### MLPClassifier (Multi level Perceptron Classifier)

Input Layer are the features of the matrix, 5 features reflect on 5 input neurons in the neural network.
Output Layer is the target of the matrix, in case of regressor algoritmh has only 1 neuron as output because it expects to return a number, in case of classifier algoritmh is possible to have 2 more neurons on output (N categories classifier = N output neurons)
